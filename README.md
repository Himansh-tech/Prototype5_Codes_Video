# FruityFun_Codes_Video  
Here I have uploaded the video and the codes of the **Fruity Fun** game, which I made while learning Unity from Unity Learn. All other assets are stored in my pendrive.  

In the video, I was not able to show the scene setup and scripts used due to the size limit on GitHub. Here is the gameplay:

### ðŸŽ® **Controls:**  
- Use the **mouse** to click on fruits and smash them to score points.  
- **Avoid clicking on bombs**, as they will reduce your score.  
- **Don't let any fruits fall**, or it will be **Game Over**!  
- You can choose from **three difficulty modes**.  
- Restart the game instantly if it gets over.
